# Contributor FAQ
## Contributor Experience
### Why contribute to LFPH projects?
There are many reasons to contribute to open source projects.

#### 1. Personal and Professional Growth
Contributing to open source projects allows you to explore, learn, and practice skills which might be unavailable in your current situation. These skills can be related to technology, or could be in community management and organisation of work, funding and enterpreneurship. You will learn firsthand about industry pain points and will have the change to propose, design, develop, and implement solutions.

#### 2. Public Proof of Success
Working in a open source environment gives your successes public visibility. Your work is also vetted by a democratic community.

#### 3. Career Development and Enterpreneurship
That public visibility can improve your standing within your organisation and the broader professional community. Your improved understanding of industry pain points will make you a better professoinal and inrease your chances of career development. Maintainers are among the first considered for employment implementing open source projects. Open source code is used in commercial, academic, public, and government settings, and even in space exploration projects. You may even develop ideas which may result in the establishment of a startup and become the beginning of your entrepreneurial career.

#### 4. Community and International Friendships
Open source projects contribute to society in a unique way. In joining an open source project, you join a diverse community. This can lead to lifelong international friendships.

#### Still have questions?

### How can I contribute?
Issues linked in the [project list](https://github.com/lfph/sig-contributor-experience/blob/master/README.md/#help-out-on-lfph-hosted-projects) have been identified by project owners as a great place to jump in. There are plenty of other operational ways to contribute as well. Joining a SIG helps LFPH run smoothly and is a great way to help out apart from development.

### What if nothing seems like a good fit?
We're constantly working to bring in more projects, so make sure to keep an eye on the [project list](https://github.com/lfph/sig-contributor-experience/blob/master/README.md/#help-out-on-lfph-hosted-projects). If you think there is an unidentified opportunity area you'd like to work on, please reach out in the [#sig-contributor-experience channel](https://lfpublichealth.slack.com/messages/sig-contributor-experience) on Slack.

### How much time do I need to have to contribute?
Different projects and SIGs need all different amounts and types of involvement. If you'd like to contribute, we can find something that works for you.

## The Public Health Landscape
### What other apps are out there?
LFPH has put together a public health [landscape](https://landscape.lfph.io/) encompassing all applications and initiatives in the public health space. LFPH-hosted projects are clearly marked within the landscape. The landscape is easily filtered and parsed from [card mode](https://landscape.lfph.io/format=card-mode).

### How does LFPH select which apps to host?
All apps can work with LFPH as long as they complete a proposal meeting LFPH requirements. LFPH does not impose governance requirements or manage its hosted projects.
