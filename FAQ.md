# Contributor FAQ

## Contributor Experience
### Why contribute to LFPH projects?
There are lots of reasons to contribute to open-source projects of any kind, which provide an opportunity to learn and grow in ways that may not be available in the workplace. 

### How can I contribute?
Issues linked in the [project list](https://github.com/lfph/sig-contributor-experience/blob/master/README.md/#help-out-on-lfph-hosted-projects) have been identified by project owners as a great place to jump in. There are plenty of other operational ways to contribute as well. Joining a SIG helps LFPH run smoothly and is a great way to help out apart from development.

### What if nothing seems like a good fit?
We're constantly working to bring in more projects, so make sure to keep an eye on the [project list](https://github.com/lfph/sig-contributor-experience/blob/master/README.md/#help-out-on-lfph-hosted-projects). If you think there is an unidentified opportunity area you'd like to work on, please reach out in the [#sig-contributor-experience channel](https://lfpublichealth.slack.com/messages/sig-contributor-experience) on Slack.

### How much time do I need to have to contribute?
Different projects and SIGs need all different amounts and types of involvement. If you'd like to contribute, we can find something that works for you.


## The Public Health Landscape
### What other apps are out there?
LFPH has put together a public health [landscape](https://landscape.lfph.io/) encompassing all applications and initiatives in the public health space. LFPH-hosted projects are clearly marked within the landscape. The landscape is easily filtered and parsed from [card mode](https://landscape.lfph.io/format=card-mode).

### How does LFPH select which apps to host?
All apps can work with LFPH as long as they complete a proposal meeting LFPH requirements. LFPH does not impose governance requirements or manage its hosted projects.
