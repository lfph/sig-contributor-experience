## The Public Health Landscape
### What other apps are out there?
LFPH has put together a public health [landscape](https://landscape.lfph.io/) encompassing all applications and initiatives in the public health space. LFPH-hosted projects are clearly marked within the landscape. The landscape is easily filtered and parsed from [card mode](https://landscape.lfph.io/format=card-mode).

### How does LFPH select which apps to host?
All apps can work with LFPH as long as they complete a proposal meeting LFPH requirements. LFPH does not impose governance requirements or manage its hosted projects.
