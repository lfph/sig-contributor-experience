# Contributor Guide Blueprint

## Purpose

This Contributor Guide Blueprint is a collection of best practices. Its purpose is to inspire Contributors when they write the Contributor Guides for their projects. The inspiration for this Guide came primarily from the Contributor Guides of the CNCF.

### How to Use

Contributors using this Blueprint do not need to use everything. They are welcome to fork it and delete, change and add at will.

The Blueprint is kept as one page to ease the overview. Some Contributors prefer to break their Contributor Guide into subpages to make them easier to read.

Pull Request Checklist (from Prometheus)

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes.
- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment, or you can ask for a review on IRC channel #prometheus on irc.freenode.net (for the easiest start, join via Riot).
- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
