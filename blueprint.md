# Contributor Guide Blueprint

## Purpose

This contributor guide blueprint is a collection of best practices. Its purpose is to inspire contributors when they write the contributor guide for their particular project. The inspiration for this guide came primarily from the [Contributor Guides](https://github.com/cncf/contribute) of the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io).

### How to Use

Contributors using this blueprint do not need to use everything.

* You are welcome to fork it and delete, change and add at will.
  * THE PROJECT and PROJECT are placeholders for the name of your project
  * to@domain.tld is a placeholder for email address
* The blueprint is kept as one page to ease the overview.
* Some contributors prefer to break their contributor guide into subpages to make them easier to read.

## Table of Contents

This guide is broken up into the following sections.
It is recommended that you follow these steps in order.

- [Welcome](#welcome)
- [Before You Get Started](#before-you-get-started)
  - [Sign the Contributor License Agreement](#sign-the-contributor-license-agreement)

## Welcome

Have you ever wanted to contribute to a cool open source technology?

We will help you understand the organization of the project and direct you to the best places to get started.

You'll be able to pick up issues, write code to fix them, and get your work reviewed and merged.

This document is the single source of truth for how to contribute to the code base.

Feel free to browse the open issues and file new ones, all feedback welcome!

## Before You Get Started

### Sign the Contributor License Agreement

Before you can contribute, you will need to sign the Contributor License Agreement.

The Linux Foundation Public Health (LFPH) defines the legal status of the contributed code in two different types of Contributor License Agreements (CLAs), individual contributors and corporations.

THE PROJECT can only accept original source code from CLA signatories.

This policy does not apply to (third_party) and (vendor).

It is important to read and understand this legal agreement.

#### How do I Sign?

### Code of Conduct

Please make sure to read and observe our Code of Conduct.

THE PROJECT follows the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting
the PROJECT Code of Conduct Committee (link) via to@domain.tld.

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Community Expectations and Roles

#### Code Review

Pull Request Checklist (from Prometheus)

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current master branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with master you may be asked to rebase your changes.
- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
- If your patch is not getting reviewed or you need a specific person to review it, you can @-reply a reviewer asking for a review in the pull request or a comment, or you can ask for a review on IRC channel #prometheus on irc.freenode.net (for the easiest start, join via Riot).
- Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature.
