# LFPH Contributor Experience
Welcome to Linux Foundation Public Health! There are a number of ways you can get involved with LFPH, outlined below. For additional details, [check out our FAQs](https://github.com/lfph/sig-contributor-experience/blob/master/FAQ.md).

## Get involved in the LFPH Ecosystem
A great first step for any path of involvement is to [join the LFPH Slack](https://slack.lfph.io). There are dedicated channels for SIGs, as well as an [#onboarding channel](https://lfpublichealth.slack.com/messages/onboarding) for any  questions about getting started.

## Help out on LFPH-hosted projects
The following projects are hosted by LFPH and open to contributor development.

Project Name | Objective | Primary Language(s) | Organization | Issues
-------------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|--------
[COVID Shield](https://github.com/CovidShield/mobile) | GAEN-based exposure notification | JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, HTML | Shopify | [Open issues](https://github.com/CovidShield/mobile/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

## Get involved in a special interest group (SIG)
SIGs oversee specific areas of relevance to the success of the overall LFPH efforts. SIGs usually meet once a month; scheduling and discussion occurs in the relevant Slack channels. If you have an idea for the formation of a new SIG, reach out in the [#sig-contributor-experience channel](https://lfpublichealth.slack.com/messages/sig-contributor-experience) on Slack.
