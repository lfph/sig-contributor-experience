## Get involved in the LFPH Ecosystem
A great first step for any path of involvement is to [join the LFPH Slack](https://slack.lfph.io). There are dedicated channels for SIGs, as well as an [#onboarding channel](https://lfpublichealth.slack.com/messages/onboarding) for any  questions about getting started.
